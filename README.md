###Janus Notes

Janus Notes is a syncing note taking program for iOS and OSX that **seriously** respect your right to privacy.

It syncs encrypted notes through Dropbox services. It is named after the Latin God Janus, depicted as having two faces since he looks to the future and to the past. Or, may be, cloud storage and privacy. Or Macintoshes and iPhone/iPad. Or sharing and control. 

The built program is available for free from the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id651141191) and the iOS [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id651150600). End user description, [FAQ](http://www.janusnotes.com/faq.html) and [Screenshots](http://www.janusnotes.com/screenshots.html) are available at [janusnotes.com](http://www.janusnotes.com).

###The code

There are two Xcode 5 projects, one for iOS and the other for OS X, respectively on the IPhone and Mac subdirectory. Forks and contributions are always welcome. 

The code will generate the programs currently online on the stores, the only required thing not in the repository is the DropboxKeys.h header, containing the app key and the secred you'll need to access the Dropbox Sync API. The header file contains only 2 useful rows
	#define DROPBOX_APP_KEY @"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
	#define DROPBOX_SECRET  @"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

The program uses many OSS libraries:
